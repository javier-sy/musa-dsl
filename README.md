A Ruby framework and DSL for algorithmic sound and musical thinking and composition.

## Description

Musa-DSL is a programming language DSL (Domain-Specific Language) based on Ruby designed for sonic and musical composition. It emphasizes the creation of complex temporal structures independently of the audio rendering engine, providing composers and developers with powerful tools for algorithmic composition, generative music, and musical notation.

**Who is it for?**

- Developers building music applications
- Researchers in computational musicology
- Live coders and interactive music performers

## Key Features

- **Advanced Sequencer** - Precise temporal control for complex polyrhythmic and polytemporal structures
- **Transport & Timing** - Multiple clock sources (internal, MIDI, external) with microsecond precision
- **Audio Engine Independent** - Works with any MIDI-capable, OSC-capable or any other output hardware or software system
- **Series-Based Composition** - Flexible sequence generators for pitches, rhythms, dynamics, and any musical parameter
- **Generative Tools** - Markov chains, combinatorial variations (Variatio), rule-based production systems (Rules), formal grammars (GenerativeGrammar), and genetic algorithms (Darwin)
- **Matrix Operations** - Mathematical transformations for musical structures
- **Scale System** - Comprehensive support for scales, tuning systems, and chord structures
- **Neumalang Notation** - Intuitive text-based and customizable musical (or sound) notation
- **Transcription System** - Convert musical gestures to MIDI and MusicXML with ornament transcription expansion

## Getting Started

### Recommended Editor: RubyMine

[RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) provides the best experience for MusaDSL development: intelligent autocomplete of methods and parameters, hover documentation, and type inference help you discover the API as you write.

**Free licenses available:**
- [Non-commercial use](https://www.jetbrains.com/non-commercial/) — for learning, hobbies, open-source, content creation
- [Students](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/student-pack/) and [Teachers/Researchers](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/teacher-pack/) — with institutional email

VSCode with the Ruby LSP extension also works well, though Ruby autocomplete and hover documentation are less complete.

### AI Composition Assistant: Claude Code Plugin

The fastest way to learn and compose with MusaDSL is through **[Nota](https://github.com/javier-sy/nota-plugin-for-claude)** — a plugin for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) that provides:

- **`/explain`** — Ask any question about MusaDSL and get sourced answers with working code examples
- **`/think`** — Creative ideation across 8 musical dimensions
- **`/code`** — Describe your musical intention in natural language and get verified MusaDSL code
- **`/analyze`** — Structured analysis of your compositions

The plugin includes a semantic knowledge base covering all MusaDSL documentation, API reference, and 22+ demo projects. Your compositions and analyses become searchable knowledge that enriches future sessions.

**Requirements:** [Ruby 3.4+](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and a [Voyage AI](https://dash.voyageai.com/) API key (free tier is sufficient for personal use).

**Install in Claude Code:**
```
/plugin marketplace add javier-sy/nota-plugin-for-claude
/plugin install nota@yeste.studio
```

Then add your Voyage AI API key to your shell profile:
```
export VOYAGE_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```

Run `/setup` to verify the installation.

### Framework Installation

Add to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'musa-dsl'
```

Or install directly:

```bash
gem install musa-dsl
```
