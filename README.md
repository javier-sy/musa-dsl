# Musa-DSL

Work in progress.

A programming language DSL based on Ruby for sonic and musical composition. 
Emphasizes the creation of complex temporal structures independently of the audio rendering engine.

Some works can be listened on [yeste.studio](https://soundcloud.com/yeste-studio) Soundcloud.
